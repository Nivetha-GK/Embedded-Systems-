Smart Traffic Management System

 Conventional traffic management systems do not account for dynamic traffic density
 and emergency scenarios, leading to:
 1. Inefficient Traffic Flow– Fixed signal timings cause unnecessary delays,
 leading to increased congestion in high-traffic areas while other lanes with
 fewer vehicles remain underutilized.
 2. Delayed Emergency Response– Emergency vehicles such as ambulances
 and fire trucks often get stuck in traffic, wasting critical time in life
threatening situations.
 3. Unsafe Pedestrian Crossings– Pedestrians struggle to cross due to short
 signal durations, increasing the risk of accidents.
 4. Environmental Impact– Excessive idling of vehicles due to poor traffic
 management results in unnecessary fuel consumption and increased CO2
 emissions.
 
 This project aims to develop a real-time adaptive traffic light system to optimize
 signal control and improve road safety using AI-driven image processing and
 intelligent decision-makingThe system enhances traffic management by:
 
  Adjusting signal duration based on vehicle density using YOLOv8.
 
  Detecting emergency vehicles and granting immediate green signal priority.
 
  Implementing pedestrian button control for safer crossings.

  Utilizing a client-server communication model for efficient processing and
 real-time decision-making.
